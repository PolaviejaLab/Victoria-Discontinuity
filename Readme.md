Setup
-----

Install the latest [Oculus runtime](https://www.oculus.com/setup).

Install the latest [LEAP runtime](https://www.leapmotion.com/setup).

Install [Unity 5.3.4p1](http://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases). Because you can install multiple Unity versions, you can include the version number in the installation path, for example: *E:\Program Files\Unity_5_3_4p1*.
 
Then install [OVRPlugin 1.3.0](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/game-engines/1.3.0/OVRPlugin_for_Unity_5/). Make sure to extract the contents of the ZIP file to the Data\VR directory!

At the moment it is not possible to install specific LEAP and Oculus runtime versions. This project works with at least 3.1.1 and 1.3.2 respectively.
